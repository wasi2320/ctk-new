      heading: "Cookies",
      content: `When you visit the Website, whether or not you register for an account, we may send one or more cookies.

"Cookies" are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters that may be placed on your web browser. Cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Website by, among other things, "remembering" your identity so that you do not have to input your password multiple times as you navigate between web pages on the Website and/or as you access the Services. This use of cookies for authentication (i.e., verifying that you are who you say you are) is an essential component of site security. You can set your web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set.

A "web beacon" is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site or in an email which allows the website to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon.

"Server logs" can be either a single log file or several log files automatically created and maintained by a server of activity performed by the server, which can include information about any transaction you conduct with the server.

Please note that if you decline to use cookies, you may experience reduced functionality or slower site response times. Declining to use our authentication-related cookies may prevent you from using the Website altogether.

We or our service providers may also collect web surfing data related to your use of the Services (e.g., information regarding which of our web pages you access, the frequency of such access, and your product and service preferences). This may be accomplished by using cookies, web beacons, page tags, or similar tools. Such web surfing data may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, clickstream data, operating system, and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Web surfing data and similar information may be used for administrative purposes; to assess the usage, value, and performance of our online products and services; and to improve your experience with the Services.`,
